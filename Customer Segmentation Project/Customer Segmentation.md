**Project Description: Customer Segmentation Dashboard**

This project entails the creation of a comprehensive Customer
Segmentation Dashboard using Tableau, leveraging a dataset sourced from
Kaggle containing details of bank customers. With a total of 4014 rows
in the dataset, the objective is to analyze how different regions are
represented within the customer base.

**Key Steps in Dashboard Creation:**

1.  **Data Preparation and Visualization:**

    -   Geographic roles were assigned to regions so that the data type
        is converted to region format.

    -   Customer segmentation was conducted based on demographics such
        as age groups and gender, with a focus on percentage
        distribution rather than raw numbers.

    -   Age groups were binned for easier interpretation of age
        distribution.

    -   Bins were created for balance distribution, with the flexibility
        of adjusting bin sizes using parameters.

    -   A tree map chart was employed to showcase job classifications
        across different segments.

2.  **Customer Segmentation Dashboard Creation:**

    -   Leveraging the prepared visualizations, a comprehensive
        dashboard was crafted to provide a holistic view of customer
        segments.

    -   The dashboard includes interactive elements for users to explore
        various demographic aspects and their distribution across
        regions.

**Analyzing Customer Segmentation Dashboard:**

Upon analysis of the dashboard, several insights were derived:

-   Approximately 40% of customers have balances below 20K, while over
    40% are below the age of 30.

-   Tailoring services towards white-collar customers in England,
    particularly in London, is suggested, given the 70% representation
    of this demographic.

-   Scotland exhibits a predominantly blue-collar job classification
    (48%) and a significant male gender representation (72%), suggesting
    a focus on targeting males in their 40s and 50s.

-   Wales demonstrates a higher balance distribution in the range of 15K
    to 30K, while Northern Ireland has a distinct demographic with most
    female workers in their late 20s and early 30s.
