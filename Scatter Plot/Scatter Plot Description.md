**What is a Scatter Plot?**

A scatter plot is a type of data visualization that is used to display
the relationship between two variables.

Scatter plots allow analysts to quickly identify patterns or trends in
data. Whether it\'s linear, non-linear, or no discernible relationship,
the plot provides immediate visual cues.

By observing the clustering of data points, analysts can gauge the
strength and direction of correlation between variables. Positive
correlation indicates both variables increase together, negative
correlation signifies one variable decreases as the other increases,
while no correlation suggests independence.

**Scatter Plot Summary: European Supermarket Sales Analysis Dashboard**

**Data Source:**

The dataset is sourced from an Excel file containing information about
orders placed by customers of a Supermarket operating across Europe. It
includes details on sales, profits, and customer locations within
different countries.

**Dashboard Overview:**

This Dashboard presents an interactive dashboard created using Tableau,
aimed at analyzing sales and profit data of the supermarket across
various states in Europe. The dashboard comprises two key
visualizations:

**1.** **European Sales Overview:**

\- This worksheet provides a comprehensive view of total sales across
different states in Europe.

-   Sales data is filtered by the year of orders and colored based on
    the calculated profit margin.

-   Bubble size indicates total sales, offering insights into regions
    with high sales volumes.

**2. Customer Sales Scatterplot:**

-   The scatterplot visualizes sales and profit for each customer,
    grouped by state.

-   Like the first worksheet, filters and color codes are applied here
    to maintain consistency.

**Dashboard Functionality:**

The dashboard is designed to be interactive, allowing users to click on
a specific state in the Euro-map to highlight corresponding data points
in the scatterplot. This feature enables users to explore detailed
insights for individual states dynamically.

**Analysis Insights:**

By leveraging the dashboard, users can gain valuable insights into the
performance of different states within Europe:

-   For instance, the analysis may reveal regions like Ile-de-France
    performing exceptionally well, while highlighting areas like Utrecht
    in the Netherlands with negative profit margins and low sales
    volumes.

-   Such insights empower decision-makers to allocate resources
    effectively, invest strategically in high-performing regions, and
    optimize operations to improve profitability.
