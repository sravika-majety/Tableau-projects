
**Project Title:** Claims Analysis Dashboard for ABC Healthcare Company

**Project Description:** 

As a data analyst, I developed a comprehensive claims analysis dashboard to provide insights into the population of patients enrolled in the company's Accountable Care Organization (ACO) care model. The dashboard leverages a claims dataset that encompasses patients enrolled in a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) insurance product. The primary goal of the dashboard is to facilitate data-driven decision-making and identify key trends and patterns in insurance claims.

**Key Visualizations and Findings:**

1. **First Visualization:** A scatter plot was constructed to explore the relationship between total payments made by insurance and patients' deductibles. Outlier points were filtered out to focus on observations where insurance payments were $2K or less. The analysis revealed a weak negative Correlation between total payments made by insurance and patients' deductibles. A trend line was added to depict this relationship. 
1. **Second Visualization:** A line graph was generated to illustrate the total payments made by insurance over time, categorized by Year and Month, for both Commercial and Medicare product lines. The analysis indicated that Medicare tends to cost more for ABC Healthcare Company. Additionally, an outlier was identified for February 2018, where the total payments made by insurance were exceptionally high. This outlier was visually highlighted on the dashboard using an annotation mark.
1. **Third Visualization:** A horizontal bar graph was created to display the sum of total payments made by insurance, grouped by provider specialty. The analysis revealed that the two highest paid provider specialties are **Internal Medicine** and **Nurse Practitioner**. These specialties were visually indicated by highlighting their bars in orange, while the rest were shaded in blue.
1. **Fourth Visualization:** A quarterly analysis of the amount spent by insurance in each state was conducted. The findings indicated that Massachusetts (MA) had the highest insurance payments in the third quarter of 2017. A timeline graph with bubbles representing states and their respective insurance payments was used to visualize the quarterly analysis. An annotation mark was employed to highlight the state with the highest insurance payments.

**Conclusion**: The claims analysis dashboard provides ABC Healthcare Company with valuable insights into insurance claims, enabling informed decision-making and resource allocation. By visually representing key findings and trends, the dashboard facilitates a deeper understanding of the company's patient population and insurance expenditure patterns, ultimately supporting the company's mission to provide quality healthcare services.
